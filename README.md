## Description
This project was something I enjoyed creating and debugging! My first step in any project is I like to sit and sketch out a rough wireframe and make note of anything specific I want my app to be able to do. (Like buttons shaped into heart). After that I look to see what code may have been provided for me, following that I create a todo list. With that I then can begin to work through the steps I created to build a simple gallery to first display my images and their respective descriptions. After, I can start to moving my information and components via props to allow the toggle function and the like button to become active.

## Usage
With this gallery my goal was to display some images that capture different parts of my life. After adding the images by sourcing them in anyone who visits the page is then able to toggle from the image to a short description by clicking the image. The user is also able to give kudos to an image by clicking the like button and increasing the counter for that image.
